=begin

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


The method is expecting 2 arguments which was set in its parameter. One is only being passed in, so it is needing an additional argument.

  =end
