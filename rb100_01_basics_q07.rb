What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'


Answer:
It is saying that there is a ')' where there should be a '}'
Perhaps it is a hash or end of a method that needs to go there?
